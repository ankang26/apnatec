ZS_2023-03-03_EP_YH	2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (ASU 2020-06), using the modified retrospective transition method.	RELATIONS:[]
ZS_2023-03-03_EP_YH	The adoption of this standard resulted in the elimination of the debt discount and related amortization as interest expense and the classification of the portion of the debt issuance costs initially allocated to equity within the carrying amount of our senior convertible notes, which will be amortized as interest expense.	RELATIONS:[]
ZS_2023-03-03_EP_YH	Additionally, ASU 2020-06 amended the calculation of diluted earnings per share for certain convertible debt instruments, eliminating the treasury stock method and requiring the use of the if-converted method to compute the underlying potentially diluted shares.	RELATIONS:[]
ZS_2023-03-03_EP_YH	Accordingly, to account for the potentially diluted shares related to our senior convertible notes, we are required to add back the non-GAAP interest expense to our non-GAAP net income and include approximately 7.63 million shares related to our senior convertible notes beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2023.

ZS_2023-03-03_EP_YH	As a result of the adoption of ASU 2020-06 on August 1, 2022, guidance for non-GAAP net income per share uses the if-converted method to calculate the potentially diluted shares related to the convertible senior notes.	RELATIONS:[]

ZS_2023-03-03_EP_YH	We have not reconciled our expectations to non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income per share to their most directly comparable GAAP measures because certain items are out of our control or cannot be reasonably predicted.	RELATIONS:[]

ZS_2023-03-03_EP_YH	Accordingly, a reconciliation for the guidance for non-GAAP income from operations and non-GAAP net income per share is not available without unreasonable effort.	RELATIONS:[]
