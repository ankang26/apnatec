ZS_2023-06-01_EP_YH	The adoption of this standard resulted in the elimination of the debt discount and related amortization as interest expense and the classification of the portion of the debt issuance costs initially allocated to equity within the carrying amount of our convertible senior notes, which will be amortized as interest expense.

ZS_2023-06-01_EP_YH	Additionally, ASU 2020-06 amended the calculation of diluted earnings per share for certain convertible debt instruments, eliminating the treasury stock method and requiring the use of the if-converted method to compute the underlying potentially diluted shares.	"{""RELATIONS"": [""""]}"
ZS_2023-06-01_EP_YH	Accordingly, to account for the potentially diluted shares related to our convertible senior notes, we are required to add back the non-GAAP interest expense related to the convertible senior notes to our non-GAAP net income and include approximately 7.63 million shares related to our convertible senior notes beginning in our first quarter of fiscal year 2023.
